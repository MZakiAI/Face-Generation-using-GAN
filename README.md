# Face-Generation-using-GAN
This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on celebrity faces to generate new faces that were not included in the training set
GANs are made up of two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator. The discriminator's job is to look at images and determine if they are real or fake. The generator's job is to trick the discriminator into classifying the generated images as real as real. 
By putting the two networks in competition with each other, we force both networks to become very smarter. You want to make Generator stronger if you want it to generate decent faces
